# Notes

* Authentication: responsible for identifying who you are
* Authorization: responsible for specifying what you can do

## Setting up OAuth

* First step is to register our app with the OAuth provider
* They will provide us with key/tokens/secret pass that will give our app access to their API


Several years ago, the only way to share data between sites
was to get users to enter the username and password into a third party's website. This third party would then login on behalf of the user to access an API.
